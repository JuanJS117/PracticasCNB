Only 2 CTTCTT ocurrences were found for gene Apetala 3 in Arabidopsis Thaliana.
Due to an unknown problem, ENSEMBL didn't allow user to show both occurrences at
the same time. When uploading a track from a file, the only ocurrence shown
corresponds to the one in the top.
So, in order to view them together, the file
Apetala3_ChromosomicCoords.gff was modified manually, changing the position
between the two ocurrences. First, the unmodified file was uploaded to ENSEMBL;
then, the file with exchanged ocurrences was uploaded. Only then the genome
browser was able to show both CTTCTT repeats at the same time.
